ssanjose: I will continue to use what I have right now which is promise chaining for handling asynchronous operaitons. However is it fine to do error handling not on any controllers but on the button handlers or should I just do error handling on the controllers and let the button handlers in the view display error messages?

GitHub Copilot: Both approaches to error handling have their merits, and the choice depends on your application's architecture and design preferences. Here are the pros and cons of each approach:

### Error Handling in Controllers

**Pros:**
1. **Centralized Error Handling**: Errors are handled in one place, making it easier to manage and update error handling logic.
2. **Reusability**: Controllers can be reused across different parts of the application without needing to duplicate error handling logic.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps the view layer clean and focused on UI rendering, while the controllers handle business logic and error management.

**Cons:**
1. **Less Granular Control**: May not provide as much control over how errors are displayed to the user in different contexts.
2. **Potential for Overhead**: Controllers might need to handle various types of errors and contexts, which can add complexity.

### Error Handling in Button Handlers (View Layer)

**Pros:**
1. **Granular Control**: Provides more control over how errors are displayed to the user in specific contexts.
2. **Context-Specific Handling**: Allows for different error handling strategies based on the specific UI component or user action.

**Cons:**
1. **Duplication of Logic**: Error handling logic might be duplicated across different button handlers, leading to maintenance challenges.
2. **Tight Coupling**: Tightly couples the error handling logic with the UI, which can make it harder to change the error handling strategy without affecting the UI.

### Recommended Approach

A balanced approach is to handle errors in the controllers and propagate them to the view layer, where they can be displayed to the user. This way, you get the benefits of centralized error handling while still allowing for context-specific error display in the UI.

### Example Implementation

**Controller with Error Handling:**

```typescript
function createTransaction(transaction: Transaction): Promise<void> {
  return FinanceTrackerDatabase.transaction('rw', FinanceTrackerDatabase.transactions, FinanceTrackerDatabase.appliedTransactions, async () => {
    const transactionId = await FinanceTrackerDatabase.transactions.add(transaction);
    transaction.id = transactionId;

    const appliedTransactions = generateAppliedTransactions(transaction);
    for (const appliedTransaction of appliedTransactions) {
      await AppliedTransactionController.createAppliedTransaction(appliedTransaction);
    }
  })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Failed to create and apply transaction:', error);
      throw error; // Propagate the error to the caller
    });
}
```

**Button Handler in View Layer:**

```tsx
import { TransactionController } from '../hooks/transaction.controller';

async function handleCreateTransaction(transaction: Transaction) {
  try {
    await TransactionController.createTransaction(transaction);
    // Display success message or update UI
  } catch (error) {
    // Display error message to the user
    console.error('Error creating transaction:', error);
    alert('Failed to create transaction. Please try again.');
  }
}
```

### Summary

- **Centralized Error Handling in Controllers**: Ensures consistency and reusability.
- **Error Display in View Layer**: Provides granular control over how errors are shown to the user.
- **Balanced Approach**: Handle errors in controllers and propagate them to the view layer for display.

This approach maintains a clean separation of concerns while allowing for flexible and context-specific error handling in the UI.
